# Schism Tracker MSIX Package

This is the [MSIX package](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N6C086Q3ZDG) source for [Schism Tracker](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker). Schism Tracker is a free and open-source reimplementation of [Impulse Tracker](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki/Impulse-Tracker), a program used to create high quality music without the requirements of specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique "finger feel" that is difficult to replicate in part. The player is based on a highly modified version of the [ModPlug](https://openmpt.org/legacy_software) engine, with a number of bugfixes and changes to [improve IT playback](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki/Player-abuse-tests).
